Chris Cooley and Philippe Langlois determined through extensive research that Twitter is an incredibly popular platform used by cyber threat actors (other than Nation State/APTs) to share claims of activity targeting a variety of entities.\r\n\r\nIn early 2015, Chris began leading the development of a cyber-focused toolkit that enables cyber intelligence analysts to find, search for, and quickly identify cyber threats to partners sourced from open source information. In mid-2015, Philippe joined the initiative dubbed \"SpydrSec\" and created a foundation for a tool built with the programming language Python, and the integration of the Twitter API. The program currently focuses on filtering through publically available information from Twitter to find threats, what is currently believed to be the most popular social media platform cyber threat actors use. This tool, now known simply as the Twitter Streamer, autonomously searches for new threats posted on Twitter on a 24/7 basis. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**How It Works**\r\n\r\nThreats are detected through keyword, domain, and Twitter account monitoring via the Twitter API. Within seconds of a public threat being posted to Twitter, an automated email notification containing intricate details of the post and the affiliated cyber threat actor is delivered to a specified recipient. These details include the platform the Tweet was created with, the unique account ID associated with the actor (which can be used to track down and actor if their screen name changes), geolocation of the tweet if available, and much more. Further analytics may be available depending on the configuration of the application.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Why is this important?**\r\n\r\nBefore the release of the Twitter Streamer, cyber intelligence analysts needed to monitor individual Twitter accounts manually to find new threats. In 2015, Chris manually monitored over 120 Twitter accounts daily, searching for cyber threat activity targeting entities related to his day job. The process is incredibly inefficient, taking a considerable amount of time and energy. \r\n \r\nThe implementation of the Twitter Streamer in any open source cyber threat intelligence program allows analysts to reduce the amount of time focused on conducting manual research on Twitter while the Twitter Streamer simultaneously increases the number of new threats discovered. The Twitter Streamer, based on the current configuration, analyzes 300,000+ tweets, detecting over 200 potential threats, in a 24 hour time period. This is a significant achievement that previously would have been unattainable without the use of automation.\r\n \r\nWhile the number of potential threats discovered is minuscule compared to the number of tweets analyzed, this figure drives home the point that the amount of manual analysis that would have previously been required to find a potential threat is not an efficient or effective use of resources.\r\n    \r\n---\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nCurrently, the operation of the Twitter Streamer must be done from the command line.\r\nYou must have the following to operate this application:\r\n\r\n* Debian Linux (other Linux kernels have not been tested - use at your own risk)\r\n     * Windows compatibility is not available at this time. \r\n* [Internet Connection](http://www.speedtest.net/)\r\n* [Intermediate Python Skills](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python)\r\n* [Twitter Development Account](https://dev.twitter.com/)\r\n\t* You will need to create a Twitter application in order to obtain API keys to use this program. \r\n\t* https://apps.twitter.com/\r\n* pip is required for the installation of the packages used for this platform. \r\n    * Install pip: `apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential`\r\n\r\n**Dependencies**\r\n\r\n_Keep in mind that basic user accounts will likely need `sudo` access to install dependencies._\r\n\r\n* Tweepy\r\n    * To install Tweepy:\r\n    `pip install tweepy`\r\n* [Gmail API](https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/quickstart/python) ( _to be removed in a later version_ )\r\n     * To install the Gmail Python API Library:\r\n     `pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client`\r\n     * Check out other installation options [here](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/start/installation)\\\r\n* Mozilla Firefox\r\n\r\n* Selenium\r\n    * To install selenium:\r\n    `pip install selenium`\r\n\r\n\r\n(This section to be updated)\r\n\r\n## How to operate\r\n\r\nThe streamer is streamlined to operate on an Ubuntu AWS instance.\r\n\r\nWe operate the streamer via an SSH connection with our AWS instance. \r\n\r\nWe use `screen` to run our script without an active SSH connection. \r\n\r\n* Screen Basic Tutorial: http://thingsilearned.com/2009/05/26/gnu-screen-super-basic-tutorial/\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n\r\n**Author:** _Philippe Langlois_\r\n\r\n* Email: philippe.langlois925@gmail.com\r\n* Github: [planglois925](https://github.com/planglois925)\r\n* Twitter: @\r\n\r\n**Co-Author & Maintainer:** _Chris Cooley_\r\n\r\n* Email: christopher.a.cooley@gmail.com\r\n* Github: [Azlirn](https://github.com/Azlirn)\r\n* Twitter: [@Cyb3rdude](https://twitter.com/cyb3rdude)\r\n\r\n## License\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nd/4.0/88x31.png\" /></a><br /><span xmlns:dct=\"http://purl.org/dc/terms/\" property=\"dct:title\">Twitter Streamer</span> by <a xmlns:cc=\"http://creativecommons.org/ns#\" href=\"https://github.com/Azlirn/Twitter-Streamer\" property=\"cc:attributionName\" rel=\"cc:attributionURL\">Philippe Langlois and Chris Cooley</a> is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License</a>.\r\n\r\n**Copyright (c) 2016 Philippe Langlois & Chris Cooley**\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n**You are free to:**\r\n\r\n* _Share_ — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format for any purpose, even commercially.\r\n    * We will not revoke these freedoms as long as everyone plays fair and follows the license terms.\r\n\r\n**Under the following terms:**\r\n\r\n* _Attribution_ — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.
